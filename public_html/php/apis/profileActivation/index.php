		/**
		 * we're sending an email upon approval of company to notify the companyAccountCreator that their company has been approved. we provide them with a link, and when they click that link, both the company and the personal profile are activated. This happens over in companyActivation, but this file, the profile activation, is called as well, so both companyActivationToken and profileActivationToken are set to null simultaneously.
		 *
		 * Here in profile activation, we activate EVERYONE'S profiles. so in order to activate a companyAccountCreatorProfile, companyActivation must call profile activation to do it simultaneously. We also need to activate profiles of employees who are invited to join the company page (as either employees or co-owners). Profile activation sends emails to employees invited that way. These emails have an activation link. The profiles have already been submitted and created by the owner(person who invited). They submitted the employee's name, email, phone(will be submitted as a filler number), and profile type(which will be selected by the owner who invited). WHen this email is sent to the employee, it has a link. when they click on the link, their profileActivationToken is set to null. Cool, well how is the employee API connected to the profileActivation API?
		 *
		 *In Employee API we are inviting new employees. But Victoria said that she does not need swiftmailer
		 *
		 * To send a message with swiftmailer, you create a transport, use it to create the Mailer, and then y ou use the
		 * Mailer to send the message
		 *
		 * We are using the SMTP Transport Type. A transport is the component that actually does the sending.
		 * SMTP (Simple Message Transfer Protocol). It is the most commonly used Transport because it will work on 99% of web
		 * servers, according to the PIDOMA analysis.
