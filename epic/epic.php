				<h2>Crumbtrail Goals</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="textfields"
				<p><strong>Crumbtrail allows food trucks to share their location and allows users to find
						food trucks that are serving now</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>What do we want it to do?  User Side: </strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The core user experience will be streamlined, with very little navigation necessary.
					When the user opens the app, they will immediately see their location on a map as well
					as tickers for any trucks in the city</li>
				<br>

				<li>User's map view (Google Maps API):</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Shows the user's location, at the center of the map.</li>
						<li>Shows the locations of nearby active food trucks.</li>
					</ol>
				<br>

				<li>User's list view (slides up from bottom of map view):</li>
					<ol>
						<li>A list of all the food trucks now serving anywhere in ABQ.</li>
						<li>A list of food trucks now serving in a specific area of town.</li>
						<li>The user can search for trucks now serving a specific type of food.</li>
						<li>The user can search for a specific food truck.</li>
						<li>By touching the name of a truck on a list, the user can see the truck's profile page.</li>
					</ol>
			<br>

			<li>Food truck profile (one page for each truck):</li>
			<ol>
				<li>(See below)</li>
			</ol>
			</ul>
			<br>


			<p><strong>What do we want it to do?  Truck Side: </strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The core food truck experience will be also streamlined, with very little
					navigation necessary. When a truck is ready to serve, the trucker hits
					one button in the app, and hungry users will immediately know the active
					truck's location.</li>
				<br>

				<li>
					<ol>
						<li>We want food truck owners to create a profile to inform users about their truck.</li>
						<li>We want them to inform the community of their current location</li>
						<li>We want an avenue for food trucks to gain more business from the surrounding community</li>
						<li>We want food truck owners to be able to post future locations</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<br>

				<div>
				<li>Food truck's "I'm serving here now" view:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>The trucker presses one button, which logs the truck in and activates the
							truck's position on the users' maps.</li>
						<li>A second button allows the trucker to see and edit the truck's profile.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
					<br>

				<li>Food truck's profile view, visible to users:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Business Name</li>
					<li>Ability to login via facebook, and share posts across multiple platforms at once
						(facebook, instagram, twitter)</li>
					<li>Photo of the truck</li>
					<li>Blurb about who they are</li>
					<li>General type of food served and/or menu</li>
					<li>Links to social media</li>
					<li>Projected locations for the week/month</li>
					<li>Review and star ratings (imported from somewhere?)</li>
				</ol>
			</ul>


			<ul>
				<li><strong>Food trucks want to be able to quickly and easily advertise their location
						when they are currently serving</strong></li>
				<br>
				<li>***when they open the app, they can see a map of the city and the food trucks that are out now.</li>
				<li>They can easily push a button that says "serving now". Will provide a pop up that will
					detect their location and autofill for them by default. They also have the option of writing
					in a different location (in the case that an administrator/boss is in charge of the profile
					and sharing where one of their employees is with the truck) </li>
			</ul>

			<p>Each truck/business has a profile that is visible to users:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>on the server side, the profile may have:</li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li>Email login/login with facebook option</li>
				<li>Password</li>
				<li>Name of business</li>
				<li>Image</li>
				<li>Social media links</li>
				<li>Automatic broadcast to social media?</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Dreamthings:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>automatic broadcast to social media</li>
				<li>social media login via facebook</li>
				<li>comment and rating system</li>
				<li>future locations of food trucks represented by pings on map</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
			<br>
			</div>
			<div class= overview>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to allow users to find food trucks both on the go and as part of future planning. The user will be able to find the food truck that suits them at that moment. There is also the other side of the site that allows food truck owners to advertise their business and location in order to receive more traffic and to inform new "eaters" of their business. </p>
